# General Store SQL Analysis

## Overview

This project is a data analysis of a general store dataset using SQL. The dataset contains sales and product details from 2015 to 2019, allowing us to explore insights such as sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and delivery patterns.

## Dataset Details

The project uses two tables:

	1.	ordercustomer
Contains details about customer orders, including sales, customer information, and shipping dates.
	•	Columns:
row_id, order_id, order_date, ship_date, state, customer_name, customer_id, city, segment, region, sales

	2.	productsales
Contains details about products sold, including categories and subcategories.
	•	Columns:
order_id, category, sub_category, product_id

## Key Objectives
	1.	Analyze sales performance across years, months, regions, and categories.
	2.	Calculate delivery times and identify trends in shipping efficiency.
	3.	Explore customer behavior, including the most frequent buyers and their orders.
	4.	Combine sales and product details using SQL joins to derive insights.
	5.	Generate meaningful KPIs for business decisions.

## SQL Techniques Used
	•	Joins:
	•	INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN to combine the ordercustomer and productsales tables.
	•	Aggregations:
	•	SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), and ROUND() for calculating sales totals, averages, and delivery times.
	•	Grouping:
	•	GROUP BY for aggregating data based on categories, regions, years, etc.
	•	Filtering:
	•	WHERE and HAVING clauses to filter data based on conditions.
	•	Sorting:
	•	ORDER BY for organizing query results.
	•	Date Functions:
	•	Used to calculate monthly and yearly trends and average delivery times.

SELECT
